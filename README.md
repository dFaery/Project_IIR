## Project Description
This project is a Final Semester Examination (UAS) assignment for the **Information and Information Retrieval (IIR)** course.  
The system is designed to perform *information retrieval* on scientific documents, with core stages including **crawling**, **preprocessing**, **feature weighting**, **similarity calculation**, and **web-based presentation of search results**.

## Scope and Features
The system development focuses on:
- Document crawling
- Text preprocessing
- Feature weighting
- Similarity calculation
- Displaying search results in a tabular format on a web interface

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional: jQuery)
- **Supporting Tools**: Git, GitHub
- **Environment**: Localhost (XAMPP)
